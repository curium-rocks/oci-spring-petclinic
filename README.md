# OCI-SPRING-PETCLINIC
This creates a multi platform container image running the spring boot pet clinic example. You can run locally with `make image` but the image is publically available `docker pull ghcr.io/curium-rocks/oci-spring-petclinic:latest`. An alpine base with Java 17 is used for this image.  This image is built nightly to bring in the latest from the alpine base and the pet clinic project.
